<h1> Welcome! </h1>

My name is Hamilton White, and I'm a C. Elegans researcher.  Since the beginning of this summer (2018), I've been working in a worm lab
as I begin my joint Ph.D. program in Central Massachusetts.  This blog is to be a blogon my musings about C. Elegans, discussion of unrefined ideas for my dissertation, and podcasts about science research and science education.

Come along on this journey over the next few years!

I'll be uploading more content soon, under not only this blog, but my podcast as well: "Paging Dr. Nematode!"
